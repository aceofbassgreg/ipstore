This is an app that stores IP addresses. It was a problem given to me for educational purposes,
and part of the problem set-up was the tests.rb file residing in the IPstore/test directory. My goal
is to use TDD and let the tests dictate where this app is headed. Once I have passing tests, I will refactor
and add anything else that is essential for this program to run effectively.
